## Overview and Introduction to Lisp
### Part One
  + black box abstraction
    - allows for looking at more complex systems without thinking about how the innards work
  + conventional interfaces
    - making sure later changes can still work in what you're designing
  + metalinguistic abstraction
    - apply eval loop
### Part Two
#### Thinking about languages.
  + primitive elements
  + means of combination
  + what are the means of abstraction
    - how do we take those complicated things so that we can use them as primitives
